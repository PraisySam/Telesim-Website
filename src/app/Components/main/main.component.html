                    Telesim Solutions is committed to addressing the needs of under-equipped healthcare workers in
                    low-resource settings by providing them with affordable medical training and education using proven

                    An estimated 1 million health care workers in Africa lack access to affordable education, training,
                    and mentorship. The current training modality for health care workers in surveillance and case
                    management of highly infectious diseases involves classroom and onsite practical instruction. This
                    modality is impractical for a highly infectious disease like COVID-19 that requires rapid training
                    to frontline healthcare workers while maintaining appropriate social distancing.

                    The current training modality is associated with two fundamental gaps/needs:<br> 1) In-person
                    training is difficult to deliver rapidly and at scale without exponentially increasing the costs in
                    time and money. This represents a major weakness when facing a condition with an exponential
                    increasing infectious trajectory in a resource-limited setting.
                    <br> 2) In-person training also has a high probability of compromised social distancing requirements
                    with risk of infection.

                    We are developing an accessible delivery platform to provide low cost education and training at
                    scale using a combination of effective technologies to maximize reach and benefits to the most
                    remote, under-served communities in Africa. Our platform will deliver training rapidly and
                    effectively while ensuring appropriate social distancing, an intervention essential for the
                    protection of both the trainer and trainee against infectious diseases.
